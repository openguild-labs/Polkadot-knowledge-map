A structured learning pathway with consolidated resources is made available for you to go through at your own pace. Read and watch all that has been provided to help you gain a better understanding of what awaits you in the Dotsama ecosystem!

## WHAT IS POLKADOT?

[Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/utm_source=devpost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=hackathon%20north%20america&utm_content=technical%20resources) is a layer-0 protocol and multichain network founded by Dr. Gavin Wood, co-founder and former CTO of Ethereum. Polkadot provides security, scalability, and interoperability to a diverse network of layer-1 blockchains called parachains. Polkadot offers several advancements over legacy blockchain networks, from governance to customization, upgradeability, energy efficiency, and more.

## WHAT IS KUSAMA?

Built on nearly the same codebase as Polkadot, [Kusama](https://kusama.network/utm_source=devpost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=hackathon%20north%20america&utm_content=technical%20resources) is a layer-0 protocol and multichain network. Kusama provides security, scalability, and interoperability to a diverse network of layer-1 blockchains called parachains, and serves as Polkadot’s ‘canary net’. Designed for radical innovation and experimentation, Kusama is used both as a live, value-bearing proving ground for Polkadot technology and as a deployment environment for early-stage startups and experimental blockchain use cases.

## WHAT IS SUBSTRATE?

[Substrate](https://www.substrate.io/utm_source=devpost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=hackathon%20north%20america&utm_content=technical%20resources) is a blockchain development framework for building and customizing parachains in the Polkadot ecosystem, as well as standalone or ‘solo’ chains. It features a completely generic state transition function and modular building blocks for common blockchain components like consensus, networking, and asset creation. By building with Substrate, development teams can significantly speed up production, reduce the cost of building a blockchain, and get much more power and flexibility than building on a smart contract platform.
